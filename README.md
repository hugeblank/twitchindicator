# twitchindicator

Displays active streams from channels you're following on twitch.
Now it's a beta version, so don't hesitate to report bugs and request some improvements.

Roadmap:
- add youtube support
- update the code to support more than 100 active streams, display search if the list is too big
- option to play stream directly in widget. Add pin feature.
- keep it simple
